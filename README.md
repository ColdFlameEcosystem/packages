# Cold Flame OS repository


## `coldflame` has the pre built packages.
1. Folder `alpha` has the current development packages from the `master` branch
2. Folder `beta` has the packages from the testing packages. Packages are fully developed, just under the development
3. Folder `preview` has the packages those are developed but are waiting for their dependencies to reach their same level.
4. Folder `release` has the packages that are distributed to the OS.

### NOTE: If you are thinking to add all of these at the same time, your system installation can break.

---
## `source` has the PKGBUILDs of packages.
`source` folder has all the packages from the default branch of their repositories. Same for alpha packages. The difference is that you can compile it yourself.
